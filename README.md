# WQE_ADPRS_PheWAS
Those are the code files for producing the PheWAS analyses in the manuscript 
"Polygenic Risk Score for Alzheimer’s Disease in a Phenome-wide Association Study: A shared genetic basis of gout and Alzheimer’s Disease". 
Part of our analyses included sensitive genomic data. Codes to produce AD PRS were not included here.
